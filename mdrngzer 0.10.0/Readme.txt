This program is designed to randomize certian parts of a PMD:Explorers of Sky nds file, such as:

Pokemon Abilities
Pokemon Movesets
Pokemon Types
Pokemon IQ Groups

The pokemon you encounter in dungeons
The items that spawn in dungeons
The terrain appearance of each dungeon
The music of each dungeon

... as well as most text in the game 
(This option could make it completely unplayable, as items/moves/abilities/mostly everything will have completely nonsensical names)

You can select a seed, or let the randomizer generate one for you.
